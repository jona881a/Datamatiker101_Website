Generel terminal commands
The reason why we use terminal to navigate, create, remove etc. instead of just using the graphical interface is to get used to a server environment where no ui is present.
An example of this are virtualmachines, you could use a program to connect to the vm with a desktop, but that is slow and unproductive.

To change directory you use the cd command like so:
cd desktop
cd.. 

To create a directory:
mkdir dirname

to create a file:
touch file.extension

Git commands
The first thing we need to do to utilize git in our project is to either clone a repo from the github cloud or to initialize the folder you are located as a git project
cloning:
git clone "link to repo"
git init (IMPORTANT! you have to be in the parent folder of your project, otherwise you could be pushing files which aren't suppose to go up to your github repository)

Node commands
The most important command to know in node is ofc to run a node project and can be done so:
node app.js

npm commands
Node package manager are the inbuild tool in nodejs which can install all sorts of dependencies, like i stated in the node section of the website, 
we use this to install express like so:
npm install express
this calls the npm website and installs all necessary files to run a full express nodejs backend.

to install nodemon livereload server we run the command:
npm install nodemon
