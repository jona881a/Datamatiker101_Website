<h2>Http and REST API's</h2>
<p>On this page we will quickly run through how the internet works with the http and https protocol, 
  how the client server model works, how we send data through the internet and finally how we build a Pure Data API (REST)
</p>

<h3>What are Http?</h3>
<p>You might have noticed the http and https before an url you type in in the browser before. 
  This is a protocol which inteprets the data that are send through between the server and the client</p>

<h4>The Http protocol</h4>

<h4>Difference between Http and Https</h4>
<p>The s in https stands for secure, which means that there is some sort of security measure taken when accessing the server with our client</p>
<p>The browser has what is called and SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport layer security) certificate which are validated by what is called a CA authority. An example from W3schools.com</p>
<img src="/pages/node/img_httpandrest/w3schools_certificate.png">
<p>how it works under the hood is in short description by exchanging keypairs (public and private) and validating that the browser and server are what they say they are.
  For more info: look up TLS handshake explained
</p>

<h3>The Client Server model</h3>
<img src="/pages/node/img_httpandrest/Client-Server-model.png">
<p>The client server model is a simple model when you look at the picture but under the hood, when you type https://google.com in the browser,
  there is much more going on than you actually realise.
</p>
<p>For starters, the client sends what we call a request to the server in form of http verbs (GET,POST,PATCH,PUT,DELETE etc) and the server sends a response in form of data or whole pages of content</p>
<p>Here we send what is called headers as well. An example could be when we request data in JSON format, we actually send a http header with application/json</p>
<p>This was just a brief overview, we could go much deeper into the client server model, but thats for whole standalone page</p>

<h3>How do we send data through the internet</h3>

<h3>The REST convention and Pure Data API's</h3>
<h4>Pure Data API and REST vs SSR</h4>
<p>A Pure Data API is one where the only purpose of it when the endpoints are called is to handle data and send it back to the client sending the request</p>
<p>SSR both handles data and assembles the view the user gets when the endpoint is requested</p>

<h4>Designing an REST API</h4>
<p>How do we design a REST API? Are there conventions and best practices? The simple answer is. Yes</p>
<p>When designing a REST API we are talking about how the endpoints the user or client should look. 
  Heres a picture of how this could look with Memes as an example
</p>
<img src="/pages/node/img_httpandrest/RESTAPIDesignMemes.png">
<p>Notice how we categorize by the resource Memes and in plural! Because we have more than one Meme.
  the id on the url are called a path variable. This variable is used to find a specific resource and do something with it.
  the questionmark is a query which means we are sending a variable to query a specific thing in the resouce.
  In the example a common thing to do is to sort by a attribute and then specifying if it is low to high og high to low. We can also query many other things.
  The ambersamp is to include more than one query in the requests querystring.
</p>

<h3>How do we make a Pure Data REST API in Node?</h3>
<p>In this section we will walk through the steps to run a fully CRUDable Pure Data REST API in NodeJS with Express</p>
<p>Firstly, the order of the requests and verbs are important to keep some sort of structure in our API to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>The API will be build in the following order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>GET</li>
  <li>POST</li>
  <li>PUT and PATCH</li>
  <li>DELETE</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example we use a array to simulate the database and instead of memes, it will be beers as a resource</p>
<p>This is our initial data in the array</p>
<img src="/pages/node/img_httpandrest/array.png">

<h4>GET requests</h4>
<p>A GET request is either to get all the resources or a specific resourse specified with an id, as discussed before</p>

<h5>GET all request</h5>
<img src="/pages/node/img_httpandrest/getall_request.png">
<p>The res.send sends JSON format array of beer objects. data is the key and the array of beers are the value</p>

<h5>GET specific request</h5>
<img src="/pages/node/img_httpandrest/getspecific_request.png">
<p>In the url request we specify an id, and the /:id is what we call a path variable which we can get from the req.params.id
  and in order to validate we need to convert it to a number with the Number() function in JavaScript because JSON is only in string format
</p>

<h4>POST</h4>
<img src="/pages/node/img_httpandrest/post_request.png">
<p>To create a new Beer object we simply type /beers but in order to POST a resource to the database, we need to either have a 
  frontend which allows us to create a JSON object or a endpoint testing client like postman.
</p>
<p>The JSON object is stored in the req variable holds the body we send with the request and like in the photo above we can access it and save it.</p>
<img src="/pages/node/img_httpandrest/current_id.png">
<p>because we don't use a database, we need to increment an id someway just like the autoincrementation feature does in mysql.
  The variable starts at 3 because that is what we currently have in the database and just like a database we increment it when creating.
</p>

<h4>PATCH</h4>
<img src="/pages/node/img_httpandrest/patch_request.png">
<p>The patch request is a little bit trickier than the other requests to create in the backend because we only need to change specific elements of the object.</p>
<p>We first use the findIndex method to find the beer with the specific index in the pathvaraible</p>
<p>Then check if the index isn't returning -1, otherwise it would throw and error and then we change the object</p>
<p>Here we make use of a brilliant little trick in the spread operator function in JavaScript. We spread out the beer and spread out the body from the request and as we now,
  the spread only changes the elements specified in the request body. Simultaneously we don't want the user to be able to update the id, that would destroy the database,
  so to combat that, we specify that id are the foundbeers id and not the spread out id
</p>

<h4>PUT</h4>
<p>There will not be a picture of the PUT request because it is nearly similar to the PATCH request 
  except we don't switch out some attributes.
  We create a new object and replace the one we found in the database
</p>

<h4>DELETE</h4>
<img src="/pages/node/img_httpandrest/delete_request.png">
<p>Just like the PATCH we first have to find the index of the requested object by using the pathvariable (converted to a number, otherwise it will throw an error)
  and if the index isn't -1, we use the splice method to remove it from the array (or delete it from our database)
</p>
